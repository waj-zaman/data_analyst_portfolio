# How to use the Tableau Embedding API

The Tableau Embedding API enables you to integrate Tableau visualizations into your own web
applications. Add custom controls, and take advantage of modern, secure methods of authentication to
interact with the visualization from your web application.

1. The Embedding API library is available in multiple versions, and each version of the library
   corresponds to a specific version of Tableau Server. For compatibility, you should use the
   version of the library that matches the version of Tableau you are using. Using the table found
   at
   [Versions of the Tableau Embedding API](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/embedding_api/en-us/docs/embedding_api_get.html#versions-of-the-tableau-embedding-api),
   determine the version of the NPM package to install. For example, if your embedded vizzes are
   hosted on Tableau version 2023.2, you should install version 3.6.x of @tableau/embedding-api.

   <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ffa500; background-color: #fff3cd; padding: 0.5em; color: #856404;">
   <strong>Warning:</strong> If your embedded vizzes are in environments where you do not control the deployed version of
   Tableau, like Tableau Public or Tableau Cloud, it is recommended to import the Embedding API
   library from the server itself—not installing it from NPM—since the server will always provide
   the latest compatible version. See
   <a href="https://help.tableau.com/current/api/embedding_api/en-us/docs/embedding_api_get.html#where-to-get-the-embedding-api-v3-library">Where to get the Embedding API v3 library</a>
   for more information.

2. Install the version of Tableau Embedding API library that is compatible with the version of
   Tableau . For example, the following command installs the v3.9.0 of `@tableau/embedding-api`
   library in the `node_modules` folder of the current directory.

   ```cmd
   npm install @tableau/embedding-api@3.9.0
   ```

3. In your JavaScript or TypeScript code, import the TableauViz object from the Embedding API v3
   library. You can then create a new instance of the object and configure the object with the path
   to the view and other properties and methods supported by the object (See
   [Configure Embedding Objects and Components](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/embedding_api/en-us/docs/embedding_api_configure.html)).
   To simplify your code and improve load times, import just the classes you need, for example
   TableauViz to create the JavaScript object and TableauEventType to set an event listener. To
   import TableauViz and TableauEventType, you would use the following:

   ```javascript
   import { TableauViz, TableauEventType } from '@tableau/embedding-api';
   ```

4. Here is an example to initialize `TableauViz` :

   #### HTML Code

   ```html
   <div id="tableauViz"></div>
   ```

   #### JavaScript/TypeScript Code

   ```javascript
   const viz = new TableauViz();

   viz.src = 'https://my-server/views/my-workbook/my-view';
   viz.toolbar = 'hidden';

   document.getElementById('tableauViz').appendChild(viz);
   ```

   It’s important to note that creating the object (`new TableauViz()`) does not render the view. To
   do that, you must add it to the DOM that is, add it to document using `appendChild()`, as in the
   example above.
