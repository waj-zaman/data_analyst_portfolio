       of the Software by any means whatsoever (except and only to the extent that applicable law prohibits or restricts reverse engineering
       restrictions and then upon notice to Salesforce); (b) sell, sublicense, rent, lease or use the Software (or any portion thereof) for
       time sharing, hosting, service provider or like purposes; (c) distribute Licensee's App with Software when Software provides the main
       functionality of the distribution; (d) remove any product identification, proprietary, copyright or other notices contained in the
       Software; (e) modify any part of the Software, create a derivative work of any part of the Software, or incorporate the Software into
       or with other software, except to the extent expressly authorized in writing by Salesforce or (e) publicly disseminate performance
       information or analysis (including, without limitation, benchmarks) from any source relating to the Software.
    1. Open Source Code. The Software may contain or be provided with components subject to the terms and conditions of third-party "open
       source" software licenses (" **Open Source Software**"). To the extent required by any license that accompanies any Open Source
       Software, the terms of such license will apply in lieu of the terms of this Agreement with respect to such Open Source Software,
       including, without limitation, any provisions governing access to source code, modification or reverse engineering.

    herein, Salesforce and its suppliers have and will retain all right, title and interest (including, without limitation, all patent,
    copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights) in and to the Software and all copies, modifications and
    derivative works thereof (including any changes that incorporate any of Licensee's Feedback). Licensee acknowledges that it is obtaining
    only a limited license right to the Software and that irrespective of any use of the words "purchase", "sale" or like terms hereunder,
    no ownership rights are being conveyed to Licensee under this Agreement or otherwise. If Licensee elects to provide any suggestions,
    comments, improvements, ideas or other feedback to Salesforce related to the Software (collectively, " **Feedback**"), Licensee agrees
    that Salesforce will be free to use, disclose, reproduce, license or otherwise distribute and exploit the Feedback provided to it as
